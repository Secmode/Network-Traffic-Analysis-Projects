# Network Traffic Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate network traffic analysis projects using **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**. Each project includes step-by-step instructions, capture files (PCAP), analysis notes, and detection suggestions — perfect for learning and for showcasing on your GitHub portfolio.

## Projects
1. [Project 1 — Capturing Traffic with tcpdump](./Project-1-Capturing-with-tcpdump/README.md)  
   Learn safe packet capture techniques using `tcpdump`, filters, storing PCAPs, and extracting sessions.

2. [Project 2 — Wireshark: HTTP & DNS Analysis](./Project-2-Wireshark-HTTP-DNS/README.md)  
   Use Wireshark to analyze HTTP and DNS activity, extract files, and identify suspicious domains.

3. [Project 3 — Wireshark: Malware C2 & TLS Analysis](./Project-3-Wireshark-C2-TLS/README.md)  
   Deeper Wireshark work: follow flows, reassemble streams, decrypt TLS (if keys available), and visualize C2-like behavior.

# Network Traffic Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains network traffic analysis projects where I downloaded real or sample PCAP files and analyzed them using **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**. The focus is on hands-on exploration of network traffic, identifying key flows, spotting anomalies, and clearly documenting the analysis process. These projects demonstrate practical network analysis skills and the ability to present findings in a structured way.

**Skills demonstrated:** Hands-on network traffic analysis, packet filtering, protocol inspection, anomaly detection, TLS decryption, and professional documentation/reporting.


## Projects
1. [Project 1 —  Traffic with tcpdump](./Project-1-Capturing-with-tcpdump)  
   Analysis of a network capture using tcpdump and Linux tools to summarize TCP traffic, highlight key flows, and identify potential anomalies.
   - Summarize TCP traffic
   - Identify top source and destination IPs
   - Detect unusual or suspicious patterns
   - Document each step of the analysis

 
3. [Project 2 — Wireshark: HTTP & DNS Analysis](./Project-2-Wireshark-HTTP-DNS/README.md)  
   Use Wireshark to analyze HTTP and DNS activity, extract files, and identify suspicious domains.
   - Inspect HTTP and DNS traffic
   - Extract files from network streams
   - Identify suspicious or malicious domains
   - Document findings with screenshots and notes

5. [Project 3 — Wireshark: Malware C2 & TLS Analysis](./Project-3-Wireshark-C2-TLS/README.md)  
   Deeper Wireshark work: follow flows, reassemble streams, decrypt TLS (if keys available), and visualize C2-like behavior.
   - Follow network flows and reassemble streams
   - Decrypt TLS traffic (if keys available)
   - Visualize potential Command-and-Control (C2) or malware behavior
   - Maintain detailed analysis documentation
